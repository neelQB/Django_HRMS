      "\n",
      "##  Description:\n",
      "\n",
      "- o Vildagliptin  is  an  orally  active  antihyperglycemic  agent  that  selectively inhibits the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme and inhibit it effectively then other Gliptins. It works as an Incretin enhancer.\n",
      "- o No adjustment of dose is necessary in either heptic or renal insufficiency.\n",
      "- o It has a relatively low risk of hypoglycemia.\n",
      "- o Well tolerated &amp; Less adverse effects\n",
      "- o Not associated with weight gain\n",
      "\n",
      "##  Mechanism of action :\n",
      "\n",
      "- o Vildagliptin inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). It inhibits the inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP by DPP-4, allowing GLP-1 and GIP to potentiate the secretion of insulin in the beta cells and suppress glucagon release by the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.\n",
      "- o Dipeptidyl  peptidase-4's  role  in  blood  glucose  regulation  is  thought  to  be through degradation of GIP and the degradation of GLP-1.\n",
      "-  GIP: Glucose dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide\n",
      "-  GLP-1: Glucagon Like Peptide-1\n",
      "- o It works by increasing the amount of two incretin hormones in the body that are produced naturally by the body in response to food intake.\n",

      "\n",
      "- o It is a Hydrophilic Matrix tablet Technology.\n",
      "- o Formulated by Direct compression method with Hypromellose.\n",
      "- o Hypromellose is a Hydrophilic  swellable  polymer  and  also  known  as Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC).\n",
      "- o It develops an external Gel layer on the surface of matrix tablet and ensures sustained release of Vildagliptin.\n",
      "\n",
      "##  What is Hydrophilic Matrix?\n",
      "\n",
      "- o Hydrophilic  matrix  tablets  are  the  most  frequently  used sustained  release oral dosage forms intended for oral administration.\n",
      "- o These hydrophilic matrices have the ability to release the drug over a defined period  of  time,  as  they  do  not  undergo  disintegration  when  delivered  to patients, as the drug is entrapped in the polymeric network at the particulate level.\n",

      "##  Hydrophilic Polymer\n",
      "\n",
      "- o Stability  and  robustness  of  the  product  is  important  aspect  for  Sustained release Tablet formulation.\n",
      "- o Vildagliptin is moisture sensitive drug and there for it has stability issues, to overcome the product stability issues, it is  mixed directly  with hydrophilic polymers of different viscosities.\n",
      "- o Biovilda ® 100 SR formulated with Hydrophilic swellable polymer ' Hypromellose  (Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose / HPMC) with combination ' of high viscosity HPMC and low viscosity HPMC at a ratio of about 60:40 to about 90:100. Among these, high viscosity polymer is directly compressible grade with excellent flow properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "##  Direct Compression Method\n",
      "\n",
      "- o Furthermore, Wet granulation and Dry granulation method which are used in Tablet formulation, which may impact in the release profile of Vildagliptin.\n",
      "- o So, we have used Direct compression method with Hypromellose (HPMC) in Biovilda ®  100 SR.\n",
      "- o It is benefited in the following way\n",
      "-  Formulate stable and robust sustained release tablet\n",
      "-  Safer for moisture-sensitive Vildagliptin\n",
      "-  No impact in the release profile of Vildagliptin\n",
      "\n",
      "##  In BIOVILDA ®  100 SR,\n",
      "\n",
      "- o We have used swellable polymer as Hypromellose (Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/HPMC).\n",
      "- o It  provides  good  compression  properties, adequate  swelling  characteristics which allow the matrix tablet to develop an external gel layer on the surface of matrix tablet, non-toxic nature, ability to give pH independent drug release profiles and amenability to high levels of drug loading.\n",
      "- o Polymer swelling,  drug  dissolution  and  matrix  erosion  are  the  phenomena that  determine  the  mechanism  of  drug  release  from  hydrophilic  matrix tablets.\n",
      "- o When drug loaded swellable cellulose ethers based hydrophilic matrices are exposed to dissolution fluid, steep water concentration gradients are formed between the dissolution fluid and the outermost surface of matrix tablet.\n",
      "- o This results in water imbibition into the polymer matrix network\n",

      "\n",
      "- o Sustained release (SR) means release of a drug substance at an adequately slow  or  controlled  rate  over  a  sustained  period,  thus  a  minimum  effective concentration of medication can provide long-term therapeutic effects after administration of a single dose. Time depends on the dosage form.  In  oral form  it  is  in  hours,  and  in  parenteral s  it  is  in  days  and months. ' o Advantages:  Decreased local and systemic side effects\n",
